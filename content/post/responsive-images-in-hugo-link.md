I was working on an upcoming post that will use a lot of images, and wanted to figure out how to pull off responsive images within Hugo.

It's not the _most_ straightforward thing.

So this is a big thank you to [Laura Kalbag and her post on creating responsive images in Hugo](https://laurakalbag.com/processing-responsive-images-with-hugo/). I basically copied her code wholesale for use in my site. I have to say that it works quite well!

This post it seems was something I can relate to - their notes for your future self. It just so happens someone else might find it useful.

Just goes to show - share what you learn!
