Woo hoo! I'm really excited to announce that I have pushed a major new version of the [Font Combinator](https://font-combinator.com "The Web Font Combinator")!

I've been working for a few months on this, and have included some sorely needed functionality. New features include: - Better Performance - Responsive Design - Variants - Color (both for Type and Background) I hope this helps a lot of people have fun with web typography!
