Something that has become evidently true at this point in my career is that I have only so much capacity for decision making. _Decisions are hard_.

And the further I get into my career, the more difficult the decisions tend to be. They often have greater consequences and I'm working on less and less information.

I personally believe that [decision fatigue](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/decision-fatigue) is very, very real. It's one of the main reasons that I feel beat at the end of some days and not others. Did I have to make a lot of decisions that day?

I have come to believe that a skill that needs a) acknowledgement and b) refinement is that of **managing decisions**:

- understanding how decisions come to you in the first place
- how many
- how often
- are you the right person to make those decisions?

## How decisions come to you in the first place?

It's helpful to have a clear idea of what your [areas of responsibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18K_8T_eHU) are - those really are going to be the source of a lot of your decisions. Your role at work. Are you a parent? (There is a universe of decisions right there.) Are you a homeowner? What volunteer roles do you have? Are you a caregiver for loved one?

Here's a hint: if you've ever said to yourself "adulting is hard" - that's a hint you probably have an area of responsibility.

Having your clear areas of responsibility is helpful because it also means you know what is _not_ your area of responsibility. You're not responsible for helping your sibling figure out their life, or helping your neighbor fix their shed.
## How many decisions are you making?

Odds are, probably hundreds per day, if not thousands. It's exhausting if you stop and think about it.

When you consciously observe how many decisions you need to make every day, you'll quickly want to figure out how to **cut down on the number of decisions that you need to make.**

There is a spectrum between cutting down needless decisions and shirking responsibility. So, tread carefully but intentionally here.
