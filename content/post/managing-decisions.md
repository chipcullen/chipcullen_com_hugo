Something that has become evidently true at this point in my career is that I have only so much capacity for decision making. _Decisions are hard_.

And the further I get into my career, the more difficult the decisions tend to be. They often have greater consequences and I'm working on less and less information.

I personally believe that [decision fatigue](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/decision-fatigue) is very, very real. It's one of the main reasons that I feel beat at the end of some days and not others. Did I have to make a lot of decisions that day?
