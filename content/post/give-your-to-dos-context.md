In your todo app of choice (I'm personally a longtime [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) user), here is a tip:

When capture to-do's, be sure to include _context_ - you future self will thank you.

For example:

> Call dentist's office

Might seem perfectly clear to you at the moment you capture it. Buuuut in three days it might not be so clear. How about:

> Call Dr. Smith's office to make an appointment about your crown

Is much more clear, and will be a lot less work to decipher later.

The extra 10 seconds you spend now might save you minutes of headscratching later.
