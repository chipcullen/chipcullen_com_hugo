I've seen a number of posts looking back at what people had read in 2018, and thought they were intesresting. I decided to look back at what I had read in 2018, and was surprised by a few things.

First, I do a lot of journaling in Day One. It's a great, great journaling app. I have one dedicated journal called "Books I've Read", where I jot down some reactions right after I've completed a book. Sometimes it's a lot, sometimes it's a sentence. But, it's the way that I keep track of what I have read.

When I _thought_ back on 2018, I would have estimated that I read about 15 books. However, looking back at Day One shows that I read **29** books. I was astounded.

(This is still pitiable compared to my wife - she read over 80 books in 2018. Let's just say I think she has a problem.)

A number of these books were introduced to me by PBS's The Great American Read - and I'm really grateful to have been recommended them.

Also - _most_ of my reading is done via audiobook. I have really come to love audibooks as they fit into my life, and make tackling very long books not intimidating.

Anyway, I'm not going to go through all 29 books here - only the top 7.

- _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn_
- _The Alchemist_
- _Neverwhere_
- _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_
- _Accelerate_
- _Eat That Frog_
- _Never Split the Difference_

## A Tree Grows in Brooklyn

This was a weird one. I had it in my head that I should read this book for years. I knew nothing about it, other than it was a classic. Finally I just plunked down and started it.

It's fantastic.

It's a coming of age story about a girl (Frannie) growing up in Brooklyn around the time that the first world war broke out. I didn't even know _this_ much about the book ahead of time. I'm glad that I didn't - had I known, I don't know htat I would have taken the time to read it.

The characters are so vivid - the worries are so relatable - you really get sucked into Frannie's world. As I am of Irish decent, it was also interesting to read about a predominantly Irish family still trying to establish itself in America.

## The Alchemist

This was an unexpected gem. I was going through the _Great American Read_ list and seeing what was available from my library. This one was. It wasn't very long - only 4 hours as an audiobook.

It is a â€¦ surreal story that goes by like a dream. It's kind of hard to describe. The story follows a shepherd boy as he follows a dream (literally) and the choices and changes he faces a long the way (and back). At the end of it, you feel more ready to embrace whim and chance in life.

## Neverwhere

My last fiction entry on this list is by Neil Gaiman. I've read one other book of his (The Graveyard Book) and enjoyed it.

I'll be honest, this one was much harder to get through. It's about a guy living in London with a non-descript job who inadvertently gets sucked into an underground world.

I had a hard time with the book because I felt like the main character just kept letting things happen to him. But, in the end, the payoff is worth it. Also, it has two of the most memorable villains in a book that I've read in a while.

## Rich Dad, Poor Dad

This book changed my life, in a manner of speaking. The title is cheesy, but you have to get past that. What it's referring to
