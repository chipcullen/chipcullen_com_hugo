Being able to confidently offer simple solutions that solve a problem is a hallmark of experience. Before even committing your fingers to a keyboard, experience will (hopefully) allow you to:

- **Question requirements.** Is something _truly_ necessary?
- **Get to the root business goal.** People don't just blindly ask for stuff without a reason - but getting to that _real_ reason can take some digging.
- **Redefine success.** Get others to see that simplicity and reliability trumps whiz-bang.

Maturity as a developer _can_ mean that you generally are better informed about a problem's context, and can possibly help clarify or _redefine_ that context.

**A conversation can save you days of development time, especially when redefining the problem allows you to offer a much simpler solution.**
